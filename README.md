# Popup Submission Form

This repository contains a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a submission form with a popup confirmation message. The form is styled with a modern and responsive design, making it suitable for various web applications.


## Features

- **Popup Confirmation**: Upon clicking the "Submit" button, a popup confirmation message appears, informing the user that their details have been successfully submitted.

- **Responsive Design**: The form and popup are designed to be responsive and visually appealing across different devices.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/popup-submission-form.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the form in action.

## How It Works

The JavaScript code attached to the form includes event listeners for the "Submit" button and the "OK" button inside the popup. When the "Submit" button is clicked, the `openPopup` function is triggered, adding a class to the popup to make it visible. Clicking the "OK" button triggers the `closePopup` function, removing the class and hiding the popup.

## Customization

- **Styles**: Customize the styles in the `style.css` file to match the visual identity of your project.

- **Images**: Replace the `tick.png` image with your preferred image for the confirmation icon.
